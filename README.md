Create your own beautiful ambient mixes. Experiment by uploading your own tracks. Explore and contribute to the rich tradition of experimental syntesized music. Sonos is an experimental app that allows users to create continousouly generateed, amibient music


Explore and contribute to the rich tradition of experimental synthesized music.

Sonos allows users to create continuously generated, infinitely morphing, ambient music in a variety of styles to suit any setting.

Choose up to five bases and five layers from existing tracks to generate you a mix. Sonos is a curated open-source platform. If you would like to contribute, use the upload feature to submit your own bases or layers.

Submission guidelines [WIP]
Submissions are uploaded as sets. Sets must contain at least 3 bases and 2 layers. Submissions are accepted as MP3 format. Your submission will be reviewed by our team before being made publicly available. Sonos is an experimental platform. We are not strict about allowing new content onto the platform. However, new content needs to appropriately contribute to the tradition of ambient music. That can be disruptive or confirmative, or anything in between, but some thought and effort is requested. Experience with music theory or formal training in music is NOT required. Only an interest and ability to generate interesting sounds. You may use traditional instruments, digital instruments, synthesizers, recorded foley, recorded ambience, or any other means you have available to generate an interesting MP3 file. Consider the following guidelines before submitting. BASES *Bases with minimal harmonic implications will allow for the greatest variety of layers. Multiple voices are preferred. For example, slowly shifting chords in the Dorian mode that shift between 2-5 voices would potentially be a suitable base given the lack of a half-tone between the fifth and final degrees of the scale. *Bases displaying minimal development (rhythmic, harmonic, timbre, tone, or otherwise) will allow layers to create these elements naturally through implication. *Bases that are 3 minutes or longer will more often result in interesting variation of the motifs provided by the layers.

LAYERS *Layers should contain a general variety in rhythm that morphs slowly more often than it morphs quickly. Voices should be more limited in number than bases. If multiple voices are included, consider using movements that imply harmony (suspensions, passing tones, canon, etc). *Layers can occasionally imply motif. Depending on the context of related layers it may be appropriate to highlight this feature of your track often with imbalance or contrast. *Layers can have more chromatic harmonic content than bases (that doesnâ€™t mean they always should). *Layers should contain variety in instrumentation and can be either short or very long. ============[WIP]==============
