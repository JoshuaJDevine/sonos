Sonos is a feature rich audio player bundled with social features. 
The UX is inspired by the Epic Games Store, Soundcloud, and Spotify.
The UI is inspired by trends in glassmorphism, neumorphism, and minimalism.

Sonos is currently under active development. Check back soon for more features and updates

You can try out the demo version @

## [WIP] Ambient track generation 
### Concept
Sonos will allow users to create continuously generated, infinitely morphing, ambient music in a variety of styles to
suit any setting. Create your own beautiful ambient mixes by uploading layers and bases to contribute to the rich 
tradition of experimental synthesized music.

### General Guildines
* Submissions are uploaded as sets. 
* Sets must contain at least 3 bases and 2 layers. 
* Submissions are accepted as MP3 format. 
* Your submission will be reviewed before being made publicly available.
  
Sonos is an experimental platform. We are not strict about allowing new content onto the platform. 
However, new content needs to appropriately contribute to the tradition of ambient music. 
That can be disruptive or confirmative, or anything in between, but some thought and effort is requested. 
Experience with music theory or formal training in music is NOT required. 
Only an interest and ability to generate interesting sounds. 
You may use traditional instruments, digital instruments, synthesizers, recorded foley, recorded ambience, 
or any other means you have available to generate an interesting MP3 file. 
Consider the following guidelines before submitting. 
  
#### BASES 
* Bases with minimal harmonic implications will allow for the greatest variety of layers. 
Multiple voices are preferred. 
For example, slowly shifting chords in the Dorian mode that shift 
between 2-5 voices would potentially be a suitable base given the 
lack of a half-tone between the fifth and final degrees of the scale. 
* Bases displaying minimal development (rhythmic, harmonic, timbre, tone, or otherwise) 
will allow layers to create these elements naturally through implication. 
* Bases that are 3 minutes or longer will more often result in interesting 
variation of the motifs provided by the layers.

#### LAYERS 
* Layers should contain a general variety in rhythm that morphs slowly more often than 
it morphs quickly. Voices should be more limited in number than bases. 
If multiple voices are included, consider using movements that imply harmony 
(suspensions, passing tones, canon, etc). *Layers can occasionally imply motif. 
Depending on the context of related layers it may be appropriate to highlight 
this feature of your track often with imbalance or contrast. 
* Layers can have more chromatic harmonic content than bases (that doesnâ€™t mean they always should). 
* Layers should contain variety in instrumentation and can be either short or very long.
